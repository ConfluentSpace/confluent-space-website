1. fix viewport for <= 1024 or whatever my phone default is
2. Resize the header image to various widths to accommodate various browser viewports
3. fix the cost table at smaller sizes (needs to be reworked possibly)
4. Hamburger menu when too small
   4.1 Add a menu item that is hidden until the viewport is small enough that triggers it
   4.2 Overlay screen(?)

Confluent site:
x footer doesn't stick to bottom on phone (do full height site)
x "smaller" font size below sizing chart isn't smaller on phone; use em
x Change 5 days (punch card) to 5 days, and move "punch card" to asterisk definition
x Change asterisk definition to "Non-consecutive; you get a punch card"
x Add meta tag for site description
x Add meta viewport tag
