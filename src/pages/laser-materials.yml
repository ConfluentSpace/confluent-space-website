                <h3>Acrylic</h3>
                <p><strong>If you need it “today,”</strong> you may wish to try <strong>RFP Plastics</strong> in Kennewick. They have a limited selection on hand, in a variety of colors and thicknesses, but are able to order in some things they don’t have. However you may be able to get a decent amount for a great price if you’re not picky. They can cut things down to size for you. They’re friendly, helpful, and honest.</p>

                </p>
                <p><strong>If you don’t mind waiting or want a larger selection of colors</strong> at your fingertips, check out <strong>ePlastics</strong> (Ridout Plastics) down in California. They can also cut things to size for you, but charge a fee for this service. However if you order multiples of the same <i>sheet size</i> then you get a discount. Do not buy anything outside their Plexiglas section, except for Delrin, as you will not be allowed to laser it here.</p>
                <p>Arthur McBain has samples of most of their colors. Send him a message on Slack or through the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ConfluentSpace/">Confluent Facebook page</a> to arrange a meet up to check them out. Some suggested categories to look in are listed below. Make sure to double check the thicknesses you add to your cart.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.eplastics.com/clear_plexiglass_sheet">Clear</a> (if you buy the kind with a film instead of paper backing, take that off before lasering)</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.eplastics.com/Plexiglass_Acrylic_Sheet_Bronze_Grey_Smoked_Gray_Colored">Transparent Bronze, gray, and smoke</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.eplastics.com/plexiglass-acrylic-sheet-transparent-colors">Transparent colors</a> (includes green-edged clear, aka “glass green” or “Coke bottle”)</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.eplastics.com/plexiglass-acrylic-sheet-translucent-colors">Translucent colors</a> (excludes black and white; mostly opaque, except to bright sources of light)</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.eplastics.com/plexiglass-acrylic-black-white">Black, gray, and translucent white</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.eplastics.com/plexiglass_acrylic_sheet_fluorescent">Translucent flourescent colors</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.eplastics.com/Plastic/acrylic-glitter-pearl">Glitter and pearly colors</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.eplastics.com/Plexiglass_Acrylic_Sheet_Mirrored">Mirrored</a> (comes clear or colored; this requires different settings, talk to Arthur McBain)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you’re ordering a lot of acrylic <strong>you might find it cheaper to use their <a href="http://www.eplastics.com/Plastic/labor_charges">labor charges page</a> to pay for your cuts all at once</strong> instead of individually when you add a sheet needing cuts to your cart. Be sure to describe what you want precisely as if there is more than one way to make the cuts you describe you might not get what you envisioned. Be sure to <strong>select send remnants</strong> as any leftovers can be useful for testing or little odds and ends.</p>

            <h3 id="linoleum">“Battleship Gray” Linoleum</h3>
            <p><strong><a href="https://www.dickblick.com/products/blick-battleship-gray-linoleum/">Blick sells</a> this kind of linoluem in a variety of sizes</strong> and mountings. You can safely laser smaller pieces out of larger ones. If you happen to be in Seattle, there’s a Blick on Broadway. (Other art stores in Seattle are also very likey to carry this product.)</p>
            <p>If you wish to buy it elsewhere, just make sure it is the same material, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleum">made with linseed oil and so on</a>. Avoid things like Speedy Carve, Speedy-Cut, or other materials that do not tell you what is in their product. Also do not buy the modern vinyl floor coverings sometimes wrongly called linoleum, as they are generally made with PVC and dangerous to laser.</p>

                <h3 id="leather">Leather</h3>
                <p>Leather is relatively easy to obtain, but <a href="https://www.tandyleather.com/en/">Tandy Leather</a> and their <a href="https://www.tandyleatheroutlet.com/">outlet</a> offer a wide variety of sources, sizes, and finishes of leather. They seem to frequently have deals and have been known to offer a full hide for over 50% off. However be aware some leather processes may put things like chromium or other products into the leather which may make them undesireable. Due to the variety of offerings from Tandy, some are called out below.</p>

            <h3>Plywood, thin hardwoods, and veneer</h3>
            <p>The best place to <strong>get plywood locally</strong> is Windsor Plywood in Kennewick. You can buy 5′x5′ sheets of Baltic Birch there as well as 4′x8′ sheets of whiteboard, and more. They even sometimes have “hobby” blocks of various woods useful for other woodworking projects. If you can’t cut down something that big yourself, be prepared to wait and to pay for it. It can take them a few hours to couple days to get to your order so don't expect a same-day pickup. This is especially true if you order on a Saturday.</p>
            <p>
                Windsor Plywood<br>
                311 N Van Buren St<br>

            </p>
            <p>For <strong>hardwoods</strong>, you can get various <a href="http://www.rockler.com/wood/domestic-lumber">domestic boards</a> from <strong>Rockler</strong>. They may not be the cheapest, but the boards are good.</p>
            <p>The aptly named <strong><a href="https://www.veneersupplies.com">VeneerSupplies.com</a></strong> run by a guy named Joe. They stock and send quality veneer in a variety of domestic and “exotic” varieties. Almost everything they sell is by the lot and each lot has its own photo. Really handy!</p>

                <h3 id="glass">Glass</h3>
                <p>If you want cheap glass cups to try engraving, go check out any local <strong>Dollar Tree</strong>. These will typically be <strong>soda-lime glass</strong> and produce a fuzzy look when engraved. Target has a variety of glassware but it’s more expensive, of course.</p>
                <p>Looking for <strong>borosilicate glass</strong>? You can get it from <strong>McMaster-Carr</strong> in <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/#glass/=1awjylc">rectangular plates</a>. Fair warning: it's expensive. They also sell other shapes and types of borosilicate glass or quartz, but they're even more expensive. Borosilicate glass will engrave very differently. It seems more suited to lines and hatch-fills rather than completely engraved areas like soda-lime glass.</p>
                <p>Borosilicate bakeware is rather hard to obtain inside the US aside from labware such as beakers, flasks, and so on. This is because the rights to the name of a large maker of household borosilicate glass, Pyrex, was sold off and the new owner uses soda-lime glass. Therefore, all glassware with a lowercase “pyrex” label is soda-lime glass but glassware with an uppercase “PYREX” is borosilicate glass. Buy from Europe or try trolling garage and estate sales if you're looking for one of those elusive PYREX borosilicate baking pans.</p>

            <h3 id="aluminum">Anodized Aluminum</h3>
            <p><strong>Inventables</strong> sells anodized aluminum in <a href="https://www.inventables.com/categories/materials/metal/anodized-and-engravable-metals">a variety of colors</a> from 3″x3″ to 12″x12″, though not all colors come in all sizes. We have a metal cutter capable of cutting metal up to 2mm thick (~.08″) to any size you desire.</p>
            <p>You might be able to find other thicknesses and sizes for cheaper on ebay, but quality is unknown and Inventables seems to have the most interesting color selection. To that end, <a href="https://www.johnsonplastics.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=anodized+aluminum">Johnson Plastics Plus</a> also sells anodized aluminum sheets, tags (luggage, pet, etc.), and a variety of other trinkety gift items.</p>

                <h3 id="metal">Stainless Steel or Brass</h3>
                <p>Pretty straight-forward suggestion: <a href="https://www.onlinemetals.com">OnlineMetals.com</a></p>
                <p>They were at the Seattle Mini Maker Faire in 2017 (at least) and seem pretty down with the whole “maker” thing. In addition they also allow you to buy any size of rectangular plate, by entering in your own values. The laser has been used to mark up some kind of brass obtained from them using CerMark and it worked out pretty well.</p>
                <p>Do note CO<sub>2</sub> lasers cannot easily mark metals so a compound such as CerMark is required. It is sprayed on to the metal, left to dry, lasered, then washed off. Anything not lasered will come off during washing. Not all metals are suitable for CerMark. If you'd like to try some, you can contact Arthur McBain on our Slack or through our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ConfluentSpace/">Facebook page</a> to arrange something. If you want your own, you can get it from <a href="https://www.johnsonplastics.com/engraving/engraving-supplies/cermark/">Johnson Plastics Plus</a> among other places. A variation of this product is known as Thermark.</p>

            <h3 id="agate">Agate</h3>
            <p><strong>Crystal River Gems</strong> sells great agate slices, and also ships very soon after ordering. Try starting on <a href="http://www.crystalrivergems.com/agate-slices-no-drilled-hole/">this page of their website</a>. Make sure to add a cherry-pick for every slice you want to suggest some aspect of. It is recommended to cherry-pick to avoid geode holes or request rounder slices, if wanted, in the larger slice sizes. Be aware your cherry-pick requests can overide your color selection if you specify something like “natural” as that will result in you getting brown.</p>
