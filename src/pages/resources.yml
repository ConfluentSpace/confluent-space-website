                <h3>Classroom, Art Studio, and Event Space</h3>
                <p>This space can fit several tables and is usable for classes, workshops, and other events. It can also be a quiet place to work on your art when not in use for any of the previous. Members have the ability to hold meetings or socials here once a month, even if some of the attendees aren’t already members, as long as they are open to the public. Just <a href="mailto:confluent.space@gmail.com">send us an email</a> so we don’t double book our <a href="/calendar">calendar</a>. This space is also bookable for private events; contact us for rates and details.</p>
