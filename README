Generating the website:

    python website.py

This will look in src/* and output the files into site/*. Every page is a YAML
file with the following format:

    %YAML 1.2
    header:
        title: Unique page title
        description: Social media link description for the page
        path: nice/URL/configured/in/webserver
        page: internal-page-name
    content: |
        Individual page content goes here, formatted as wanted.

The path property should not include a leading or trailing slash. The page
property needs to  match the name of the extra style and image files needed by
the page. The pipe indicates the content that follows is pre-formatted, so any
indentation and spacing matters.

The library ruamel.yaml is required to be installed (via pip).

When generating the site, every page source will be read in, as well as the nav,
header, and footer source files. The header is then populated with the metadata
and the nav, content, and footers are concatenated before writing out the final
file to the site directory.
