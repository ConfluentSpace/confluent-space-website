1st time setup (assuming you already have virtualenv installed):

    cd confluent-space-website
    virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install ruamel.yaml
    deactivate

You can name "env" whatever you want, but out on Confluent's production site it
is called env. If you don't have virtualenv, you can install that globally with
pip, but if you're in an environment where you don't have rights to do so, then
you are stuck. You also don't need to deactivate immediately, you can continue
to the next step and skip the activation step as well as performing any other
tasks before deactivating.

Generating the website:

    source env/bin/activate
    python website.py
    deactivate

This will look in src/* and output the files into site/*. Every page is a YAML
file with the following format:

    %YAML 1.2
    header:
        title: Unique page title
        description: Social media link description for the page
        path: nice/URL/configured/in/webserver
        page: internal-page-name
    content: |
        Individual page content goes here, formatted as wanted.

The path property should not include a leading or trailing slash. The page
property needs to match the name of the extra style and image files needed by
the page. These are located under site/styles site/images/<page>, respectively.
The pipe indicates the content that follows is pre-formatted, so line breaks and
any indentation beyond that putting it below the content property are preserved.

When generating the site, every page source will be read in, as well as the nav,
header, and footer source files. The header is then populated with the metadata
and the nav, content, and footers are concatenated before writing out the final
file to the site directory.
